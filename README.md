# Learning Goals

# Project Goals

# What to Do
1. Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation.
2. Clone this repo to your local machine.
3. `cd` into the directory that was created when you cloned the repo (it should be called `hw3-spookytext-<your-github-id>`).
4. Implement `handleChangeText()`, `handleReverseText()`, and `handleReverseColors()`.
5. Push your final changes to GitHub before the deadline.
6. Create a screencast video and submit the link to Canvas before the deadline.
7. Indicate in your Canvas comments which requirements (including extra credit) you believe you met.

# Notes
* Be sure to show that the switches can operate independently. 
* Also show that existing text is reversed when the "Reverse Text" is switched "On" and that new text is reversed when the  switch is already on.
* A `reverseText()` function is provided. This will come in handy.
